# dotfiles

This is a .dotfile repository for configuration files I need when transferring between operating systems or computers.

## Auto-linking

file can be automatically linked with the included Ruby script. Simply run ´$ ./install.rb´ and the files will be linked according to where they are usually found in the Linux user's home directory.

## TODO

- [x] Add script to automatically symlink needed files (add 20/7/18)
- [ ] Create branches for specific purposes (ex. for desktop, server, and various Linux flavors)
- [x] Create a *sane* folder system
- [ ] integrate subtrees/submodules (especially for vim)
