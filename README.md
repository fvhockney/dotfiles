# dotfiles

This is a .dotfile repository for configuration files I need when transferring between operating systems or computers.

## TODO

- [ ] Add script to automatically symlink needed files
- [ ] Create branches for specific purposes (ex. for desktop, server, and various Linux flavors)
- [x] Create a *sane* folder system
- [ ] integrate subtrees/submodules (especially for vim)
